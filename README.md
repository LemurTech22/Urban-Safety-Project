ðŸš§ Urban Safety Insights (In Progress)

Welcome to the Urban Safety Insights project!
This project is currently under development, so some components may still be incomplete or in progress.
ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build an interactive data visualization platform that identifies areas with high concentrations of vehicle accidents â€” such as intersections, highways, regions affected by severe weather, or incidents involving impaired driving (DUI).

By analyzing and visualizing these patterns, the project aims to:

    *Raise public awareness about dangerous driving conditions

    *Inform state and local officials on where infrastructure improvements may be needed

    *Support proactive safety measures to reduce accident frequency and severity

Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance public safety, reduce vehicle repair costs, and improve quality of life by contributing to safer, more informed urban planning. After all, ensuring people return safely to their loved ones is what matters most.
